🌾 Smart Farming Crop Recommendation System 🌱

An intelligent crop recommendation system using Machine Learning and a GUI demonstration for smart farming.

This project predicts the most suitable crop based on soil type, weather, irrigation, and fertilizer data. It demonstrates both data analysis using ML and a user-friendly GUI for farm recommendations.

🚀 Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to help farmers make informed decisions by predicting which crops are best suited for their land and environment.

Key Highlights:

Machine Learning-based crop prediction using Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.

Feature selection to identify the most influential soil and weather parameters.

Standalone Tkinter GUI for demonstration.

Dataset includes soil type, N-P-K content, temperature, rainfall, and irrigation factors.
